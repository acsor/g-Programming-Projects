# /g/'s Programming Projects v4.0

[/g/](http://boards.4chan.org/g/)'s Programming Projects for beginner to
advanced developers, featuring version 4.0 of the manifesto. This a fork from
[keplr/programming-projects-for-n00bz](https://github.com/keplr/programming-projects-for-n00bz).

The problems are in random difficulty order. For more information (difficulty
level, tips etc.) refer to
[Pro/g/ramming Challenges v4.0](ProgrammingChallengesv4.0.png).

Lastly, the Programming Challenges v4.0 image file was translated into text by
means of an OCR software, and reformatted into this `README.md` file through
`markdown_formatter.py`.

## How to Play
Last three digits of your post decide. If none, run `./problem_picker.py`.

Happy Rolling!

## Challenge Tier
* Conways Game of Life with an Improvement Algorithm.
It should be given a starting pattern, and after the starting pattern when a generation dies or stops significant movement (repeats itself indefinately).
* Scan the entire IPv4 range, from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 and log IP's that host webservers in a database.
I take no responsibility if anybody comes knocking on your door.
